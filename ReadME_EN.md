# NodeRed Contrib FUXA  

Currently in the demo testing phase, plugin development is not yet planned. The purpose is to validate technical feasibility. More detailed updates will follow in the future.  

## Usage Instructions  
1. Download the source code to the specified folder. (It will later be published to the NodeRed repository as a connector component between NodeRed and FUXA.)  
2. Install the plugin in the NodeRed root directory.  
   For example, if your file location is `E:\work_space\vscode\node-red\packages\node_modules\@node-red\nodes\core\FUXA`, use the following command to install:  
   `npm install E:\work_space\vscode\node-red\packages\node_modules\@node-red\nodes\core\FUXA`  

4. Use the FUXA component:

   The plugin will automatically retrieve FUXA data, allowing you to bind values from FUXA.  

5. Send data test:
